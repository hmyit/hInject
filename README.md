# hInject

hInject is a open-source DLL Injector. Written in C++ with Qt.

# Features
There is not much but It's still under development and new features will be added.
  - One supported Dll Injection Method(Create Remote Thread with LoadLibrary)
  - You can add only one Dll.
  - It's only supported in Windows and maybe Linux support will be added.

### ToDo List
(High Priority to Lowest)
  - Multiple Injection Methods(SetWindowsHookEx, AppInit_DLLs Injection etc.)
  - Multiple Dlls to Inject one process.
  - Some fancy stuff. =)

Well I want to directly compete with Extreme Injector. There is still some bugs and other stuffs to need fix. I will take care them as much as I find time.
